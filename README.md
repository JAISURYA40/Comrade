## 🎯 The Problem

> **Motivation exists. Consistency doesn't.**

Diwakar is a college student who struggles to study for 10 minutes  
—but can scroll reels for hours.

He wants success.  
He lacks **focus, structure, and sustainable execution**.

### ⚠️ Problems Faced

- 🚀 Productivity apps feel like rocket science  
- 🧭 Big dreams, zero roadmap, lost midway  
- 🔋 Week 1: Fully charged → Week 2: 3%  
- 🥗 Health sacrificed while chasing goals  

### 📊 Reality (Backed by Research)

- **53%** of students lose 5+ hours daily to doomscrolling  
- **92%** abandon goals due to lack of structure  
- **96 phone checks/day** during study sessions  

**This is not laziness — it's a system failure.**
